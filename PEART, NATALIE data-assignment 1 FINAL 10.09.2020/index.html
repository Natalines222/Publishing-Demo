        <h2>The Tool</h2>
        <p> Housing activists would like to ban the annual tax lien sale held by New York City. The tax lien sale is a tool that allows the city to recoup costs from property owners who have not paid property
          taxes or water and sewer bills. The city uses a contracted vendor to sell homes or other properties to a an anonymous third-party buyer. It's a short-term way for the city to make quick cash. Advoctaes argue that while it may provide
          short-term cash, it creates a longer-term expense for the services that the city will have to provide for individuals and families that the tax lien sale law destabilizes.</p>

        <h2>The Issue </h2>
        <p>The selling of properties with liens against them creates a destabilizing effect for families. This year, there were 9,000 New Yokers on that list, 4,700 of whom are erroneaously listed and many from communities of color living in
          single-family homes. Queens Borough President,
          Sharon Lee, stated that of the eligible properties, "1,566 are considerd Tax class 1 or residential properties. She went on to say, "This lien sale right now is inhumane. It will disrupt generational wealth and it will destabilize
          families."
          In New York City this year, the annual tax lien sale was scheduled for May but was postponed due to the pandemic. In a normal year, local elected officials have time to reach out to people in their communities who are on the lien list. They
          host events where community members can learn what to do and begin to set up payment plans with representatives from the Department of Finance, the branch of the city that handles liens. These efforts were affected this year due to
          COVID-19.

        <h2>The Call</h2>
        <p>In addition to demands by local elected officials to postpone or cancel the tax lien sale for this year only, housing activists and community groups want to get rid of the lien sale altogether. They cite that the tax lien sale was not
          always apart of city policy. It was enacted in 1997 and it is a viewed by some as a
          leftover, extractive element of former mayor Rudolph Guilani's administration. The tax lien sale was enacted in 1997. "This law...what we've seen, this is simply a theft of land. We are seeing homes and families being put into speculation
          and it has accelerated the debt in communities like Brownsville, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island," says Alfred Scott member of the East New York Community Land Trust. There is an expiration date for the tax lien sale and that is
          December 2020. In addition to petitions, advoctes demand that the New York City Council and the Mayor vote to not reauthorize the law and sale process.
