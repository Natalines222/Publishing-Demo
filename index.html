      <section class="text">
        <p> From the time I was a child, I was always interested in the traditional arts and the esoteric arts. I have channeled that interest into practicing as a media worker, yoga teacher and astrologer. Born in Trinidad and Tobago to a
          Trinbagonian mother and Jamaican father, I love my West Indian bloodlines. I live and work in the county of Kings.</p>
